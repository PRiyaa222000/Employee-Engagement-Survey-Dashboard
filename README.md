# Employee-Engagement-Survey-Dashboard

Employee engagement is a critical factor in driving productivity, retention, and overall workplace satisfaction. To help decision-makers track and enhance engagement levels, I built this interactive Employee Engagement Survey Dashboard using Power BI, equipped with tooltips, filters, and comparative analytics.

🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard:

78.2% engagement rate—a 7.1% increase from last year, indicating positive workforce sentiment.
📌 Engagement Breakdown by Job Role:

Directors (83%) show the highest engagement, followed by Managers (78.7%) and Executives (78.1%), while Juniors (76.1%) are the least engaged.
✅ Decision-making insight: HR & leadership can focus on mentoring junior employees and addressing concerns specific to new hires.
📌 Comparing 2024 Engagement Against Industry Benchmarks & Last Year:

The column chart with tooltips provides a detailed comparative analysis across six key areas:
✔️ Leadership

The open-ended survey responses highlight key concerns:
